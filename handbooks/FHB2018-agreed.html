                        and perform service without interference and without jeopardizing
                        employment. This freedom is central to the University’s mission and
                        purpose and entails the right to participate in public life, to criticize
                        University or other administrations, governments or public figures, to
                        champion unpopular positions, to engage in frank discussion of
                        controversial matters, to raise questions and challenges which may be
                        viewed as counter to the beliefs of society, and to act according to the
                        Member's standards as a professional in the Member's field.

            <p>WHEREAS the University wishes to establish an on-campus day care facility on the
               Lethbridge campus of the University;
            </p>
            <p>WHEREAS the Faculty Association has agreed to contribute funding towards the
               capital/financing costs of a day care facility;
            </p>
            <p>THEREFORE the parties hereto agree as follows:</p>
            <p> 1. University Responsibilities:</p>
            <p> 1.1 University of Lethbridge will construct a day care facility on its Lethbridge
               campus if and when the project is approved by the Board of Governors of the
               University.
            </p>
            <p> 1.2 The University of Lethbridge will contribute funding of at least 65% of the
               capital costs for construction of the day care facility. 
            </p>
            <p> 1.3 The University of Lethbridge will enter into a Lease with an external day
               care provider which will include provisions to the following affect:
            </p>
            <p> a) The University as the Landlord will set the initial allocation of spaces for
               children attending the day care between children of undergraduate students,
               children of Member, children of graduate students, children of employees of the
               day care provider and children of others, and shall have the exclusive right to
               change the allocation of spaces with such change to be effective at the beginning
               of the next academic semester;
            </p>
            <p> b) The Tenant shall agree to charge a reasonable and competitive day care fee for
               the day care services provided which will be comparable to the fee charged by the
               other day cares operating within the City of Lethbridge;
            </p>
            <p> c) The Tenant shall keep the Day Care Centre open for business and in normal
               operation at least 10 hours per day, Monday to Friday inclusive, with the
               exception of holidays or holiday periods during which the University is
               closed.
            </p>
            <p> 2. Faculty Association Responsibilities:</p>
            <p> 2.1 The Faculty Association shall make a one-time payment of $20,000.00 towards
               the construction costs of the day care facility which shall be paid by the Faculty
               Association to the University on or before September 1, 2009. 
            </p>
            <p> 2.2 The Faculty Association agrees that each member of the Faculty Association
               will contribute the sum of $1.80 per month for each month that the individual is a
               member of the Faculty Association commencing September 1, 2009 with such
               contributions to continue by Faculty Members for a period of 20 years following
               the date the day care opens for operation. 
            </p>
            <p> 2.3 In the event that the day care facility is not in operation due to the
               absence of a day care provider prior to September 1, 2009, the individual monthly
               contributions by member s of the Faculty Association shall be suspended for the
               period during which the day care facility is not in operation commencing with the
               month immediately following the month in which the day care operation was
               suspended or discontinued with such contributions resuming with the month
               following the month in which the day care facility recommences operation. 
            </p>
            <p> 2.4 The Faculty Association agrees that the monthly contributions shall be
               automatically deducted by the University from the remuneration paid to each
               Faculty Member and on behalf of each Faculty Member hereby authorizes the
               University to make such a deduction. In the event that an amendment to the
               collective agreement between the University and the Faculty Association agree to
               take such steps as may be required to give effect to these provisions, the
               University and the Faculty Association agree to take such steps as may be required
               to amend the collective agreement accordingly. 
            </p>
            <p> 2.5 The Faculty Association will provide annual input, by July of each year, to
               the Vice-President (Finance and Administration) in relation to the annual
               Landlord/Tenant review meetings on issues or recommendations related to the Day
               Care Centre. 
            </p>
            <p> 3. This Agreement shall endure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties
               hereto and their respective successors and assigns.
